config CAN_VCAN
	tristate "Virtual Local CAN Interface (vcan)"
	depends on CAN
	default N
	---help---
	  Similar to the network loopback devices, vcan offers a
	  virtual local CAN interface.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called vcan.

config CAN_DEV
	tristate "Platform CAN drivers with Netlink support"
	depends on CAN
	default Y
	---help---
	  Enables the common framework for platform CAN drivers with Netlink
	  support. This is the standard library for CAN drivers.
	  If unsure, say Y.

config CAN_CALC_BITTIMING
	bool "CAN bit-timing calculation"
	depends on CAN_DEV
	default Y
	---help---
	  If enabled, CAN bit-timing parameters will be calculated for the
	  bit-rate specified via Netlink argument "bitrate" when the device
	  get started. This works fine for the most common CAN controllers
	  with standard bit-rates but may fail for exotic bit-rates or CAN
	  source clock frequencies. Disabling saves some space, but then the
	  bit-timing parameters must be specified directly using the Netlink
	  arguments "tq", "prop_seg", "phase_seg1", "phase_seg2" and "sjw".
	  If unsure, say Y.

config CAN_SJA1000
	depends on CAN_DEV && HAS_IOMEM
	tristate "Philips SJA1000"
	---help---
	  Driver for the SJA1000 CAN controllers from Philips or NXP

config CAN_SJA1000_ISA
	depends on CAN_SJA1000 && ISA
	tristate "ISA Bus based legacy SJA1000 driver"
	---help---
	  This driver adds legacy support for SJA1000 chips connected to
	  the ISA bus using I/O port, memory mapped or indirect access.

config CAN_SJA1000_PLATFORM
	depends on CAN_SJA1000
	tristate "Generic Platform Bus based SJA1000 driver"
	---help---
	  This driver adds support for the SJA1000 chips connected to
	  the "platform bus" (Linux abstraction for directly to the
	  processor attached devices).  Which can be found on various
	  boards from Phytec (http://www.phytec.de) like the PCM027,
	  PCM038.

config CAN_SJA1000_OF_PLATFORM
	depends on CAN_SJA1000 && PPC_OF
	tristate "Generic OF Platform Bus based SJA1000 driver"
	---help---
	  This driver adds support for the SJA1000 chips connected to
	  the OpenFirmware "platform bus" found on embedded systems with
	  OpenFirmware bindings, e.g. if you have a PowerPC based system
	  you may want to enable this option.

config CAN_EMS_PCI
	tristate "EMS CPC-PCI, CPC-PCIe and CPC-104P Card"
	depends on PCI && CAN_SJA1000
	---help---
	  This driver is for the one, two or four channel CPC-PCI,
	  CPC-PCIe and CPC-104P cards from EMS Dr. Thomas Wuensche
	  (http://www.ems-wuensche.de).

config CAN_EMS_USB
	tristate "EMS CPC-USB/ARM7 CAN/USB interface"
	depends on USB && CAN_DEV
	---help---
	  This driver is for the one channel CPC-USB/ARM7 CAN/USB interface
	  from from EMS Dr. Thomas Wuensche (http://www.ems-wuensche.de).

config CAN_KVASER_PCI
	tristate "Kvaser PCIcanx and Kvaser PCIcan PCI Cards"
	depends on PCI && CAN_SJA1000
	---help---
	  This driver is for the the PCIcanx and PCIcan cards (1, 2 or
	  4 channel) from Kvaser (http://www.kvaser.com).

config CAN_TI_HECC
       depends on CAN_DEV
       tristate "TI High End CAN Controller"
       ---help---
         Driver for TI HECC (High End CAN Controller) module found on many
         TI devices. The device specifications are available from www.ti.com


config CAN_AT91
	tristate "Atmel AT91 onchip CAN controller"
	depends on CAN && CAN_DEV && ARCH_AT91SAM9263
	---help---
	  This is a driver for the SoC CAN controller in Atmel's AT91SAM9263.

config CAN_DEBUG_DEVICES
	bool "CAN devices debugging messages"
	depends on CAN
	default N
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want the CAN device drivers to produce a bunch of
	  debug messages to the system log.  Select this if you are having
	  a problem with CAN support and want to see more of what is going
	  on.
